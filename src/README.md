CARHUB

Welcome to CarHub an upcoming car dealership that enables the users to view our available vehicles. They get the information about the Car price, model Year, engine capacity.
One unique feature is that we are able to give the user the ability to check for lost vehicles in out database. 

Through a GET request we display the cars into cards with the year, model, price and transmission. Upon clicking you the user is taken to a page that has more of the  car information such as the state of the car.
We also enable a user to add vehicles to out catalogue through a form 
We also enable the user to navigte through the website using client side routing
